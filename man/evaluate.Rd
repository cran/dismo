\title{ Model evaluation }

\description{ 
Evaluation of models with presence/absence data. Given a vector of presence and a vector of absence values (or a model and presence and absence points and predictors), confusion matrices are computed (for varying thresholds), and model evaluation statistics are computed for each confusion matrix / threshold. See the description of class \code{\link{ModelEvaluation-class}} for more info.

\usage{
evaluate(p, a, model, x, tr, ...)
}
 
\arguments{
  \item{p}{presence points (x and y coordinates or SpatialPoints* object). 
  
          Or, if \code{x} is missing, values at presence points
		  
		  Or, a matrix with values to compute predictions for}
		   
  \item{a}{absence points (x and y coordinates or SpatialPoints* object). 
  
			Or, if \code{x} is missing, values at presence points.
			
			Or, a matrix with values to compute predictions for}
			
  \item{model}{any fitted model, including objects inheriting from 'DistModel'; not used when \code{x} is missing (and both a and p are vectors)}

  \item{x}{Optional. Predictor variables (object of class Raster*). If present, \code{p} and \code{a} are interpreted as (spatial) points }
  
  \item{tr}{Optional. a vector of threshold values to use for computing the confusion matrices}
  
  \item{...}{Additional arguments for the predict function}  
}

\value{
An object of \code{\link{ModelEvaluation-class}}

\examples{
## See ?maxent for an example with real data.
# this is a contrived example:
# p has the predicted values for 50 known cases (locations) 
# with presence of the phenomenon (species)
p <- rnorm(50, mean=0.7, sd=0.3)
# a has the predicted values for 50 background locations (or absence)
a <- rnorm(50, mean=0.4, sd=0.4)
e <- evaluate(p=p, a=a)

threshold(e)

plot(e, 'ROC')
plot(e, 'TPR')
